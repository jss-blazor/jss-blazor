# JSS Blazor

![JSS Blazor](assets/jss-blazor-banner.svg)

JSS Blazor is a client SDK for [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] that enables
you to build client web apps entirely in C# with [Blazor WebAssembly][2].

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

At the moment, JSS Blazor is a **proof of concept** to demonstrate the
capabilities of [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] beyond JavaScript frameworks
and to also give a preview of what .NET Core component development could look
like with Sitecore. It is not yet ready for production use.

JSS Blazor is not an official Sitecore module and is in no way, shape, form, or
fashion supported by Sitecore.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This repository consists of the JSS Blazor SDK, which can be found in the `/src`
folder, and a Styleguide sample site found in the `/samples` folder.

If you want to see JSS Blazor in action or get a feel for how it works, the
[ðŸŽ¨ Styleguide](#-styleguide) is the best place to start.

## ðŸ’¼ Prerequisites

You need the following installed to work with Blazor:

1. [Visual Studio 2019 16.4.0 Preview 5][3] or greater.
2. The latest Blazor WebAssembly project template.

To install the Blazor WebAssembly project template:

```powershell
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates::3.1.0-preview3.19555.2
```

## ðŸ”§ SDK

The JSS Blazor SDK allows you to build new websites with JSS Blazor. To get
started working with the JSS Blazor SDK, follow along with its [README][4].

## ðŸŽ¨ Styleguide

The Styleguide sample site is built using all of the same components and content
found in the boilerplate app for new JSS Angular, React, and Vue.js projects.

To get started with the Styleguide, follow along with its [README][5].
