# Blazor Framework for Sitecore JavaScript Services

The Blazor Framework for [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] allows you to build
full-featured websites on top of Sitecore, entirely in C#, using
[ASP.NET Blazor][2].

The aim of this project is to have feature parity with the existing Angular,
React, and Vue.js frameworks for [Sitecore JavaScript Services][1] so you can
build your sites without writing a bit of JavaScript! 😎

This repository consists of the JavaScript Services Blazor SDK, which can be
found in the `/src` folder and a Style Guide sample site built using Helix
principles found in the `/samples` folder. The Style Guide sample site is built
using all of the same components and content as found in the boilerplate
projects for JSS Angular, React, and Vue.js.

## Style Guide

To get started with the Style Guide, follow along with its [README.md][3].
